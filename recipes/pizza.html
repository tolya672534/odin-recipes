        Once your pizzas are loaded with toppings, it's time to 
        fire up the grill! Unless you have an outdoor pizza oven (see below),
        an outdoor grill is your best bet for backyard pizza. Using a pizza stone
        or steel is going to help you mimic that wood-fired taste. Baking pizza on
        aluminum foil will also work, but it won't produce quite the same crust.
